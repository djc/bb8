# bb8

A generic connection pool, designed for asynchronous tokio-based connections.
This is an asynchronous [tokio](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio)-based version of [r2d2](https://github.com/sfackler/r2d2).

[Documentation](https://docs.rs/bb8)

Opening a new database connection every time one is needed is both inefficient
and can lead to resource exhaustion under high traffic conditions. A connection
pool maintains a set of open connections to a database, handing them out for
repeated use.

bb8 is agnostic to the connection type it is managing. Implementors of the
`ManageConnection` trait provide the database-specific logic to create and
check the health of connections.

A (possibly not exhaustive) list of adaptors for different backends:

Backend | Adaptor Crate
------- | -------------
[tokio-postgres](https://github.com/sfackler/rust-postgres) | [bb8-postgres](https://crates.io/crates/bb8-postgres)
[redis forked from mitsuhiko by Marwes](https://github.com/Marwes/redis-rs/) | [bb8-redis](https://crates.io/crates/bb8-redis)



## Example

Using an imaginary "foodb" database.

```rust
use std::thread;

extern crate bb8;
extern crate bb8_foodb;

fn main() {
    let manager = bb8_foodb::FooConnectionManager::new("localhost:1234");
    let pool = bb8::Pool::builder()
        .max_size(15)
        .build(manager)
        .unwrap();

    for _ in 0..20 {
        let pool = pool.clone();
        thread::spawn(move || {
            let conn = pool.get().unwrap();
            // use the connection
            // it will be returned to the pool when it falls out of scope.
        })
    }
}
```
